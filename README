= CouchRest Model Elastic

*WARNING:* Under construction, please do not use (yet)!!

ElasticSearch support for the CouchRest Model library. Uses [Slingshot](http://karmi.github.com/slingshot/)'s
powerful DSL but uses a more familiar approach for CouchRest users that fits in well with other CouchDB views.
